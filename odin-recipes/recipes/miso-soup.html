        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sliced green onions</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white miso paste</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable stock base</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups cooked rice vermicelli noodles</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced shiitake mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced baby bok choy</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut tofu into 1/2 inch planks. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat
            cook tofu, turning halfway through, until golden, about 6-8 minutes. Cut tofu into
            cubes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir together green onions, miso paste, garlic, stock base, and ginger in a small bowl.
            Divide evenly among 3 microwave-safe, pint-size canning jars with lids.
        </li>
        <li>
            Layer evenly with rice vermicelli noodles, tofu, mushrooms, and bok choy. Chill covered
            up to 5 days.
        </li>
        <li>
            To serve, let jar stand at room temperature 10 minutes, or run under warm water 1 minute.
            Add water (about 1 cup) to ingredients in jar until nearly full. Microwave without the lid 
            for 3 minutes. Carefully screw on lid (jar will be very hot). Let stand 5 minutes. Invert 
            jar to combine ingredients. Garnish with sliced green onions.
        </li>
