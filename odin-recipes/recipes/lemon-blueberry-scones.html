    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the scones:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, frozen</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream, plus 2 tablespoons for brushing</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 heaping cup fresh or frozen blueberries (do not thaw if frozen)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coarse sugar for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the lemon icing:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Whisk flour, sugar, lemon zest, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.
            Grate the frozen butter using a box grater. Add it to the flour mixture and combine
            with a pastry cutter, two forks, or your fingers until the mixture comes together in
            pea-sized crumbs. Place in fridge or freezer as you mix the wet ingredients together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk 1/2 cup heavy cream, the egg, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl.
            Drizzle over the flour mixture, add the blueberries, then mix together until everything
            appears moistened.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour onto the counter and, with floured hands, work the dough into a ball. The
            dough should be sticky. If it's too sticky, add a little more flour. If it's too
            dry, add 1-2 more tablespoons heavy cream. Press into an 8-inch disk, and cut into
            8 wedges
        </li>
        <li>
            Brush scones with remaining heavy cream, and sprinkle with coarse sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place scones on a plate and refridgerate for at least 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 F
        </li>
        <li>
            Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Place scones
            2-3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet(s).
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 22-25 minutes, or until golden brown around the edges and lightly browned on top.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Make the icing:</strong> Whisk the icing ingredients together. Drizzle over warm 
            scones. Left over iced or un-iced scones will keep at room temperature for 2 days, 
            or in the fridge for 5 days.
